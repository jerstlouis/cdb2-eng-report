= An analysis experiment to explore 'whole-of-CDB X' Integration_Experimental_Analysis

This is the development of a scenario within which to analyze and explore how CDB X will provide for inheritance of top-level 'parent' metadata, making a 'small change' in an already developed and deployed CDB X dataset, and how a change in resource constraints in a small high LOD area is aggregated back 'up' into higher packaging of CDB X.
