== CDB-X Attribution

One of the strengths of CDB that it provides on top of the underlying geospatial standards it deploys is the adoption of a controlled semantic vocabulary for feature types, attributes, and values. This approach - variously called a data model, a feature dictionary, or an entity catalog - is a necessary component of semantic interoperability between simulations. This going beyond specifying the physical geometry, spatial referencing, and file formats used to represent the CDB data store to ensure simulations have a consistent and correlated deep understanding of the content - to ensure a road is always a road, a lake is distinct from a river, and so on.

The current CDB standard for attribution has not integrated ongoing development and standards developed by other activities since OGC CDB 1.0. For several years, there have been discussions concerning how to modify the CDB standard to support newer feature attribution coding schemes and controlled vocabularies to go beyond the current FACC-based approach. While the existing CDB standard theoretically supports representing other controlled vocabularies (with some gaps identified in this report), at this time no changes to the CDB standard to adopt or promote other coding schemes has occured. This section provides 1.) information on the current approach in CDB 1.x, 2.) requirements for evolving the CDB standard to accommodate newer coding schems and 3.) the experimental framework and results from the work in the CDB-X activity.

=== Current CDB 1.x Attribution Approach

OGC CDB versions 1.x use a CDB Feature Data Dictionary (FDD) as the controlled vocabulary for attribution.  An Excel spreadsheet version of the CDB 1.X Feature Data Dictionary is available on the public https://external.ogc.org/twiki_public/pub/CDBswg/WebHome/CDB_FDD.xlsx[CDB wiki].

The CDB V1.x feature codes and subcodes are primarily based on the https://gwg.nga.mil/documents/asfe/DGIWG_FACC.htm[DIGEST Feature and Attribute Coding Catalog 2.1] (FACC) with additional concepts from a few other sources.  From that website: _FACC) specifies geospatial information concepts used by member nations of the multi-national Defence Geospatial Information Working Group (DGIWG) community. These concepts characterize aspects of real-world entities (or objects) and related properties, including those that are not necessarily visible or have a tangible physical form (e.g., airspace). The DGIWG FACC is a comprehensive dictionary and coding scheme for feature types, feature attributes (properties or characteristics associated with features), and attribute values (domain of feature attributes)._

[The abbreviations and acronyms are defined and/or expanded in the OGC CDB 1.x Standards and Best Practices documents]

In the FACC, each major feature category is further divided into subcategories identified by the second character of the five-character code containing an alphabetic value from "A" to "Z". Finally, the third, fourth, and fifth characters of the five-character feature code are a numeric value from 000 to 999. This value provides unique feature type identification within categories. Thus, all features must be identified by all five alphanumeric characters; e.g., the feature named "Building" is denoted by the code "AL015". Feature codes are listed in Annex A of the FACC Data Dictionary.

Each feature is associated with a textual description, which provides a human readable dictionary definition for the feature. Each Feature Code is also associated with a short human readable name.

=== Ongoing Standards Development

FACC was officially sunsetted (retired) by its parent standards body DGIWG on December 31, 2012 after a long deprecation period. It was replaced by successor standards Digital Feature Data Dictionary (DFDD) and associated US National System for Geospatial Intelligence (NSG) National Feature Data Dictionary (NFDD). These successor standards were a largely compatible superset of the FACC codes and definitions, so many commercial and government tools and standards - including CDB 1.0 - largely continued with FACC despite it being officially retired. The successor standards did bring in additional definitions loosely inspired by ISO/IEC 18025:2005 and maritime definitions from  IHO ENC S-100. The NFDD standard eventually was reformulated into a more abstract NSG Core Vocabulary (NCV) and NSG Application Schema (NAS) which recast the existing standards in terms of logical data models expressed using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and the semantic Web Ontology Language (OWL) vocabulary; strictly speaking both the DFDD and NFDD have been retired as well.

The US Army Geospatial Center codified the NAS 7.0 into a practical subset with encoding standards for Shapefiles and SQL databases, and this particular application schema became the Ground-Warfighter Geospatial Data Model (GGDM). Through a set of various NATO initiatives, the parallel DFDD eventually became the Defence Geospatial Information Model that also aligned with the NAS 7.0, albeit with more divergence. Subsequently, NSG has published an official NAS 8.0 update and follow-up quarterly updates with the most recent update being the NAS X-3 published on June 30, 2020. These updates introduce substantive changes to move away from legacy representations, separated out the traditional FACC 5-letter feature codes and 3-letter attribute codes into a separate "Platform Specific Model" document, and to align with OGC GML concepts. However, the core of NAS even today is still very recognizably derived from its distance FACC ancestor.

Directly relevant to this experiment is the selection of GGDM 3.0 as the basis for the US Army Synthetic Training Environment (STE) One World Terrain (OWT) data model in Octoboer 2019. The STE Cross-Function Team saw substantial benefits to moving toward NAS by using GGDM after verifying that the GGDM met the majority (over 90%) of current requirements for the existing SE Core use cases for the Army that were currently met by a different data model derived from ISO 18025, although substantial gaps for future use cases were identitied that were relevant to this experiment. Unlike the Army Geospatial Center use case for Shapefiles and GeoPackage SQLite tables for point, linear, and polygon features, the OWT use case primarily intends to deploy GGDM attribution attached to triangle mesh models which will have relevance to notional glTF mesh layers and geotypical and geospecific models explored in other sections of this Engineering Report.

=== CDB-X Discussion and Requirements for CDB-X Experimentation

==== Experimentation Background

Migrating the CDB attribution to GGDM was an early improvement identified for CDB X based on input from current CDB stakeholders over a number of OGC CDB SWG meetings and the assessment and direction of the STE One World Terrain identified as being a desirable interoperability target. Greg Peele, one of the Tech Sprint participants, has described his work as a sub-contractor on the team recommending a Data Model for the U.S. Army One World Terrain (OWT) effort in multiple presentations to the OGC Interopable Simulation and Gaming Domain Working Group.  Greg's most recent - though slightly out of date relative to OWT development and this experiment - OGC presentation entitled *"Entities, Attributes, and Enumerants, Oh My!  Applying GGDM for Interoperable One World Terrain Semantics"* to the ISG DWG may be found here:
https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=93666

The GGDM itself is, in practice, a selection of 624 feature types (with some duplicates for different geometry representation) with a set of associated attribution for each feature type. For attributes with a controlled set of values - also known as enumerants or codelists - the set of values is either explicitly enumerated with integer codes or externally referenced via a separate dictionary of text strings. In principle every GGDM feature type should match up to an NAS logical entity, every GGDM attribute should match up to an NAS attribute, and every GGDM enumerant should match up to an NAS listed value; all of these should then line up with vocabulary terms defined in the NCV. In practice, GGDM did augment the NAS with a small number of additional definitions integrated from the NGA Topographic Data Store (TDS) and the US Environmental Protection Agency Water Resource Database (WRDB).   

Given the historical lineage of the NAS and GGDM, there is a substantial overlap between GGDM and the DIGEST FACC standard integrated into CDB 1.0. However, neither standard is a strict superset of the other. NAS and GGDM have changed existing definitions inherited from FACC as well as adding many new definitions. CDB has made substantive changes to add a new concept of "Feature Subcode" that did not exist in prior standards, bring in different definitions from ISO 18025, and add new definitions for aeronautics and building interior components. STE One World Terrain, in particular, had identified gaps in the GGDM standard for building interiors, aeronautics, vegetation, and materials which are all current CDB use cases, so the existing CDB extensions may prove complementary rather than redundant.

==== Experimentation Goals
. Establish that GGDM can replace existing FDD and identify mismatches in metamodel
. Identify changes in CDB storage structure, if any, moving to GGDM would cause
. Identify impacts, if any, on client use of CDB data
. Conduct initial mapping of CDB FDD to GGDM and identify gaps and mismatches
. Cross-reference gaps to parent standards NAS and NCV if available
. Cross-reference current and planned approach to other OGC standards
. Cross-reference to OWT work for interoperability

. Identify what could be done in CDB 1.3 as backward compatible changes to XML and Vector datasets

==== Some questions to be addressed during experimentation

. GGDM/NAS define standard layers that subdivide vector features into semantic sets (i.e. hydrology, industry, extraction, etc.). Is this meaningful to CDB? Or is it irrelevant?
. GGDM can be cross walked to NGA TDS 7.1. What are the missing attributes between M&S and TDS?
. Is there a challenge on the Sim for reading Feature Codes Vs Attribution?
. What are the format implications: vector and mesh formats must support GGDM attribution and entity types?
. Metadata: GGDM defines metadata as attributes. Encoding decision: separate metadata table referenced from features via foreign key? Or flattened metadata attributes present on every feature?
. GGDM does not have mandatory attribution fields. All fields are optional. What are the implications?
. What attribution is missing from GGDM for CDB?
