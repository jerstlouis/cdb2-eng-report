== CDB-X Attribution

One of the strengths of CDB as an interoperability standard, beyond the underlying geospatial standards it deploys, is the adoption of a controlled semantic vocabulary for feature types, attributes, and values. This approach - variously called a data model, a feature dictionary, or an entity catalog - is a necessary component of semantic interoperability between simulations. The feature attribution model goes beyond specifying the physical geometry, spatial referencing, and file formats used to represent the CDB data store to ensure simulations have a consistent and correlated deep understanding of the content semantics - to ensure a road is always a road, a lake is distinct from a river, width and height always has a consistent meaning, and so on. This semantic interoperability is necessary to ensure proper operation of simulation behaviors both for supporting human players and artificial intelligence agents.

The current CDB standard for attribution is primarily based on the officially obsolete DIGEST Feature Attribute Coding Catalogue (FACC) standard and has not integrated ongoing development and standards developed by other activities since OGC CDB 1.0. For several years, there have been discussions concerning how to modify the CDB standard to support newer feature attribution coding schemes and controlled vocabularies to go beyond the current approach. While the existing CDB standard theoretically supports representing other controlled vocabularies through modifying the CDB metadata XML (with some gaps identified in this report), at this time no changes to the CDB standard to adopt or promote other coding schemes has occured. This section provides 1.) information on the current approach in CDB 1.x, 2.) requirements for evolving the CDB standard to accommodate newer coding schems and 3.) the experimental framework and results from the work in the CDB-X activity.

=== Current CDB 1.x Attribution Approach

OGC CDB versions 1.x use a CDB Feature Data Dictionary (FDD) as the controlled vocabulary for attribution.  An Excel spreadsheet version of the CDB 1.X Feature Data Dictionary is available on the public https://external.ogc.org/twiki_public/pub/CDBswg/WebHome/CDB_FDD.xlsx[CDB wiki].

The CDB V1.x feature codes and subcodes are primarily based on the https://gwg.nga.mil/documents/asfe/DGIWG_FACC.htm[DIGEST Feature and Attribute Coding Catalog 2.1] (FACC) with additional concepts from a few other sources.  From that website: _FACC) specifies geospatial information concepts used by member nations of the multi-national Defence Geospatial Information Working Group (DGIWG) community. These concepts characterize aspects of real-world entities (or objects) and related properties, including those that are not necessarily visible or have a tangible physical form (e.g., airspace). The DGIWG FACC is a comprehensive dictionary and coding scheme for feature types, feature attributes (properties or characteristics associated with features), and attribute values (domain of feature attributes)._

[The abbreviations and acronyms are defined and/or expanded in the OGC CDB 1.x Standards and Best Practices documents]

In the FACC, each major feature category is further divided into subcategories identified by the second character of the five-character code containing an alphabetic value from "A" to "Z". Finally, the third, fourth, and fifth characters of the five-character feature code are a numeric value from 000 to 999. This value provides unique feature type identification within categories. Thus, all features must be identified by all five alphanumeric characters; e.g., the feature named "Building" is denoted by the code "AL015". Feature codes are listed in Annex A of the FACC Data Dictionary.

Each feature is associated with a textual description, which provides a human readable dictionary definition for the feature. Each Feature Code is also associated with a short human readable name.

=== Ongoing Standards Development

DIGEST FACC, which was originally developed by the Defence Geospatial Intelligence Working Group (DGIWG) in June of 1991 based off of earlier standards, was most recently updated to the widely used 2.1 version in September of 2000. FACC was officially sunsetted (retired) by DGIWG on October 17, 2012 and by the NSG on December 31, 2012 after a long deprecation period. It was replaced by successor standards Digital Feature Data Dictionary (DFDD) and associated US National System for Geospatial Intelligence (NSG) National Feature Data Dictionary (NFDD). These successor standards were a largely compatible superset of the FACC codes and definitions, so many commercial and government tools and standards - including CDB 1.0 - largely continued with FACC despite it being officially retired. The successor standards did bring in additional definitions loosely inspired by ISO/IEC 18025:2005 and maritime definitions from  IHO ENC S-100. The NFDD standard eventually was reformulated into a more abstract NSG Core Vocabulary (NCV) and NSG Application Schema (NAS) which recast the existing standards in terms of logical data models expressed using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and the semantic Web Ontology Language (OWL) vocabulary; strictly speaking both the DFDD and NFDD have been retired as well. 

The current NAS specification also introduced substantial vocabulary changes describing the metamodel itself - the most substantial one is that the term "feature" was generalized into the more abstract term "entity" to accommodate vehicles, lifeforms, devices, and abstractions like metadata and statistics. The term "enumeration" is still in use to describe a controlled vocabulary of attribute values, but the alternate term "codelist" is also used and the actual values themselves are generally referred to as "listed values." The NAS also introduced a new conceptual model for relating different entities through "associations" - such associations themselves are also entities that mediate complex relationships.

The US Army Geospatial Center codified the NAS 7.0 into a practical subset with encoding standards for Shapefiles and SQL databases, and this particular application schema became the Ground-Warfighter Geospatial Data Model (GGDM). Through a set of various NATO initiatives, the parallel DFDD eventually became the Defence Geospatial Information Model that also aligned with the NAS 7.0, albeit with more divergence. Subsequently, NSG has published an official NAS 8.0 update and follow-up quarterly updates with the most recent update being the NAS X-3 published on June 30, 2020. These updates introduce substantive changes to move away from legacy representations, separated out the traditional FACC 5-letter feature codes and 3-letter attribute codes into a separate "Platform Specific Model" document, and to align with OGC GML concepts. However, the core of NAS even today is still very recognizably derived from its distance FACC ancestor.

Directly relevant to this experiment is the selection of GGDM 3.0 as the basis for the US Army Synthetic Training Environment (STE) One World Terrain (OWT) data model in Octoboer 2019. The STE Cross-Function Team saw substantial benefits to moving toward NAS by using GGDM after verifying that the GGDM met the majority (over 90%) of current requirements for the existing SE Core use cases for the Army behaviors that were currently met by a different data model derived from ISO 18025, although substantial gaps for future use cases were identitied that were relevant to this experiment. Unlike the Army Geospatial Center use case for Shapefiles and GeoPackage SQLite tables for point, linear, and polygon features, the OWT use case primarily intends to deploy GGDM attribution attached to triangle mesh models at the mesh level, the vertex level, the triangle level, and applied to model surfaces via raster coverage texturing. The OWT 3D model approach is also relevant to notional glTF mesh layers and geotypical and geospecific models explored in other sections of this Engineering Report.

=== CDB-X Discussion and Requirements for CDB-X Experimentation

==== Experimentation Background

Migrating the CDB attribution to GGDM was an early improvement identified for CDB X based on input from current CDB stakeholders over a number of OGC CDB SWG meetings and the assessment and direction of the STE One World Terrain identified as being a desirable interoperability target. Greg Peele, one of the Tech Sprint participants, has described his work as a sub-contractor on the team recommending a Data Model for the U.S. Army One World Terrain (OWT) effort in multiple presentations to the OGC Interopable Simulation and Gaming Domain Working Group.  Greg's most recent - though slightly out of date relative to OWT development and this experiment - OGC presentation entitled *"Entities, Attributes, and Enumerants, Oh My!  Applying GGDM for Interoperable One World Terrain Semantics"* to the ISG DWG may be found here:
https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=93666

The GGDM itself is, in practice, a selection of 624 feature types (with some duplicates for different geometry representation) with a set of associated attribution for each feature type. For attributes with a controlled set of values - also known as enumerants or codelists - the set of values is either explicitly enumerated with integer codes or externally referenced via a separate dictionary of text strings. In principle every GGDM feature type should match up to an NAS logical entity, every GGDM attribute should match up to an NAS attribute, and every GGDM enumerant should match up to an NAS listed value; all of these should then match vocabulary terms defined in the NCV. In practice, GGDM did augment the NAS with a small number of additional definitions integrated from the NGA Topographic Data Store (TDS) and the US Environmental Protection Agency Water Resource Database (WRDB). 

GGDM adapted the more abstract NAS entity types by binding them to specific geometric representations: Point, Curve (Linear / Line String), Surface (Polygon), and Table (abstract / no geometry). Each such geometric binding shared the same 5-letter FACC-like code, but suffixed the feature name with an appropriate character 'P', 'C', 'S', or 'T'. The attribute definitions were bound to entity types per entity geometry, so in cases where more than one geometry applied to the same entity type, a particular may be present on one but not the other or on both depending on the specification. In the vast majority of cases GGDM only defined one geometry type per entity type however. The GGDM developers did clarify that an implementation that did not split out entity types by geometry but used some other mechanism to constrain attribute presence by geometry type to align with GGDM requirements would still be considered compliant with GGDM since in both cases the results comply with the more abstract NAS parent standard.

GGDM also organized entity types into a "feature index" that specified broader themes or layers such as Hydrography; these themes were also specific to each geometry type. The feature index also defined five levels of detail: Global, Regional, Local, Specialized, and Composite. Each entity type was cross-referenced to specify in which themes the entity belonged to at each level of detail, or to mark that a feature was not represented at a particular of level of detail. This approach to feature organization substantially diverged from the base NAS standard, which instead defined a set of "view groups" (more abstract) and "views" (more specific) to create a two-level hierarchy of entity type organization but did not define any levels of detail. The GGDM feature index themes appear to be related to an older version of the NAS "view groups" but the two are curretly out of sync. Unlike in GGDM, NAS views are non-exclusive so an entity type may belong to more than one view, although one view is typically marked as the primary view for that entity type.

One substantial innovation of NAS and GGDM over earlier standards is moving from a flat table-based feature dictionary to a full logical data model, which allows for multi-valued attributes, range-valued attributes, complex attributes with named sub-fields, and relationships between features. The NAS logical data model expresses these innovations in pure UML without implementation guidance, while the GGDM defines an encoding to represent them in traditional table-based systems.

For multi-valued attributes, GGDM defines a separate attribute for each value, with the second value and so on suffixing the attribute name with the element index - e.g. for FFN "Feature Function", the first value would be FFN, the second value would be FFN2, the third value would be FFN3, and so on. GGDM sets a max cardinality of 3, but there is no technical reason why more values could not be used.

For range-valued attributes, GGDM splits them into three attribute values of upper, lower, and interval closure (an enumeration describing whether the lower and upper values are considered part of the range) - for example for WDA "Average Water Depth" you would have WDAL "Average Water Depth <lower bound>", WDAU "Average Water Depth <upper bound>", and WDAC "Average Water Depth <interval closure>" as three separate attributes.

Finally, for complex aggregate attributes and feature relationships, GGDM defines a scheme to take the logical value relationship as a hierarchy and flatten it into prefixed attributes that combine the datatype or feature type with the target attribute code; GGDM defines this flattening such that no attribute code exceeds 10 characters however so some particularly complex attributes have the prefixed names truncated. An example of a complex aggregate attribute is RIN_RTN "Route Identification <route designation>" - the NAS UML defines Route Identification as a separate class with a Route Designation attribute. An example of a feature relationship expressed as an attribute is ZI006_MEM "Note : Memorandum" which is a reference to a feature of type Note with an attribute value of Memorandum. In some cases the related features are fully embedded in the source feature and thus duplicated for every feature; in others the related feature is referenced by a foreign key using the UFI "Unique Entity Identifer" attribute.

Each of these three cases can also be combined with each other - for example, a multi-valued or range-valued attribute on a related feature, or a chain of multiple aggregated or related features - although doing so tends to quickly hit the 10 character truncation limit for the attribute code. While currently used for Shapefiles and GeoPackage implemetnations, this particular encoding scheme for complex attributes is not strictly necessary to claim GGDM conformance; directly representing multi-valued, range-valued, and complex attributes natively by some other mechanism such as JSON, binary markup, or separate SQL tables would still be considered compliant with the GGDM logical data model so long as the attribute semantics remains the same.

Given the historical lineage of the NAS and GGDM, there is a substantial overlap between GGDM and the DIGEST FACC standard integrated into CDB 1.0. However, neither standard is a strict superset of the other. NAS and GGDM have changed existing definitions inherited from FACC as well as adding many new definitions. CDB has made substantive changes to add a new concept of "Feature Subcode" that did not exist in prior standards, bring in a different se of definitions from ISO 18025, and add new definitions for aeronautics and building interior components. STE One World Terrain, in particular, had identified gaps in the GGDM standard for building interiors, aeronautics, vegetation, and materials which are all current CDB use cases, so the existing CDB extensions over FACC may end up being complementary to GGDM rather than redundant.

==== Experimentation Goals

Given the strong consensus that GGDM represents an appropriate path forward for CDB X, we planned an experiment to validate this hypothesis and determine what gaps and difficulties this change would introduce, with a particular focus on any changes in CDB storage structure would be implied by moving to GGDM. During the initial Phase 3 of the CDB X Tech Sprint, we created an initial metamodel describing the proposed schema for representing the target GGDM data model and a notional SQLite metadata encoding to store it in a more runtime-efficient way than the current CDB 1.0 XML metadata.

The first planned experiment was to create a prototype software code library representing the proposed CBD X feature dictionary metamodel. This prototype would define runtime classes for each of the metamodel concepts and implement a proof of concept reader that could load both the existing CDB 1.0 XML feature and attribute dictionary metadata as well as loading the GGDM 3.0 entity catalog as conventionally formatted in an Excel spreadhseet. The prototype would then finally implement proof of concept support for storing the dictionary content in the proposed SQLite metadata encoding, with a stretch goal of also implementing sample XML and JSON encodings for comparison. The primary goal of the first experiment was not necessarily to fully implement all of the capabilities, but rather use the prototype to identify and document any deficiences or mismatches in the proposed CDB X feature dictionary metamodel - ideally with proposed corrections - that would interfere with migrating existing CDB 1.0 feature data or representing the proposed GGDM 3.0 dictionary.

Since CDB 1.0 and GGDM have essentially compatible semantics of what an entity (feature) type is, the next phase of the experiment was to assess data model mappings between GGDM, TDS, and CDB to determine how cleanly the existing CDB feature types translate to GGDM feature types and identify any substantial gaps in GGDM as well as mappings that lose precision or involve additional complexity. We are particularly interested in identifying how much of the mapping preserves the existing CDB feature code, feature name, or ideally both. We also plan to use the gaps identified to suggest a mitigation strategy for filling those gaps either using existing CDB 1.0 definitions or from other open standards. In this experiment we also planned to examine similar efforts conducted by SE Core and STE One World Terrain. While initial assessments suggested that attribution and enumerant values would likely map mostly directly due to both CDB and GGDM largely pulling from the same FACC ancestry, we also planned to document any mismatches we found regarding attribute values. We also planned to review GGDM and NAS entity types and attribution for describing feature-level metadata to propose a possible mechanism to implement that in CDB X. Ideally, as a stretch goal, we planned to adapt the prototype software library developed for the first experiment to use name and code matching to generate an automated mapping to compare with the manual assessment.

The third "experiment" is more of a thought experiment to coordinate with the tiling, vector features, and 3D model breakout groups to identify what changes to the feature dictionary and data model will imply on changes to structure and content of the CDB datasets - particularly vector and 3D model datasets. This will identify the key areas of standards development for attribution outside of the feature dictionary metadata itself. It may also inspire changes to the CDB dataset structure and content to better align with the target GGDM data model.

=== CDB X Experiment Findings

The three experiments conducted successfully generated a number of findings initially captured as Github tickets. The prototype code library for the feature attribute metamodel was partially implemented to a sufficient degree to identify the mismatches with both the CDB 1.0 feature dictionary and the target GGDM 3.0 data dictionary and provide partial implementation for both the core SQLite encoding and the stretch goal XML encoding, but not the JSON encoding. These results generated substantial interest among the One World Terrain stakeholders to sponsor the completion of the prototype code library targeted at the One World Terrain data model use case. The breakout group reviewed and assessed a number of mappings and reports between GGDM, TDS, and CDB 1.0 to capture the major mismatches and findings. However, we did not achieve the stretch goal of using the code library to generate automated mappings for comparison so this remains as future work. Finally, after substantial discussion on Slack and via Github, we identified the relatively few areas where changing the GGDM data model had a substantive impact on the CDB dataset storage.

==== Entity Metamodel Comparison

The CDB 1.0 entity metamodel is overall roughly similar but less complex than the GGDM and NAS entity metamodel; this is to be expected since all of these standards derived from the same FACC metamodel but the NAS and GGDM have undergone substantial development sense then. NAS and GGDM renamed the "feature" concept to the more general form "entity" to accomodate things that were not traditionally considered features like devices, lifeforms, vehicles, and abstract ideas. However, the basic notion of an entity being a particular phenomenon with a unique identity in the simulated or real world that is described by attributes with particular values is stil the same. NAS and NCV explicitly define a semantic hierarchy of entity type subclassing that refines very general and abstract entities into specific entity types in an object-oriented class hierarchy, which can be very useful for semantic understanding of complex datasets. This hierarchy is implicit and assumed in GGDM. It does not exist at all in CDB 1.0 modulo being implicit for a few items brought in from external standards for building interiors and explicitly via the generalizations (more in terms of aggregation than subclassing) specified by the category/subcategory organization of entity types and by feature subcodes.

Both the CDB 1.0 and the GGDM represent entity types using a 5-letter code mostly inherited from FACC, although GGDM has modified some existing codes and both have added new ones. CDB 1.0 specifies entities purely abstractly and then specifies a recommended geometry type and data set for each entity type, as well as relying on the semantics of the first two letters of the FACC-like 5 letter code to organize entity types for 3D model storage. GGDM specifies entities separately per geometry type using a suffix on the entity name and does specify a theme (data set) for each entity type, albeit separately for each of five levels of detail. GGDM and NAS entities may be related to other entities through associations which is a concept that does not currently exist in CDB 1.0 but may prove very useful for data de-duplication, feature-level metadata, and annotation. CDB 1.0 additionally defines a specific semantic concept of feature subcode that does not exist in GGDM and NAS. 

Primitive attributes are also essentially the same conceptually - they describe a particular quantiative or qualitive property of an entity type using a name, a short code, and a data type, a measurement unit for measured quantities, and constraints on the values. In traditional FACC the attribute codes are always 3 characters. CDB added a number of additional attributes with 4 character codes. GGDM attributes are typically 3 character codes for simple attributes, however suffixed attributes for multi-valued and range-valued attribute are 4 characters and prefixed attributes for complex data types and feature relationships may be up to 10 characters. The primitive data types of Boolean true/false, integer, real number, text, and (partially) enumeration are essentially the same in both standards, although the multi-valued, range-valued, and complex attribute value types in GGDM do not have an equivalent iN CDB 1.0. While the core concept of attributes is equivalent, the details of constraints, in particular, do vary substantially. Another substantive difference is that attributes are bound to datasets in CDB 1.0 but are bound individually to geometry-specific entity types in GGDM. CDB also has a concept of optional attributes with default values to fill in missing information, whereas all attributes are mandatory in GGDM and no default values exist.

The controlled vocabulary for qualitative attribute values - enumerations, codelists, etc. - is similar conceptually. For closed vocabulary sets, GGDM and CDB 1.0 are essentially compatible in that they identify a list of terms and assign them numeric indices. For open vocabulary sets that reference external standards, GGDM specifies them using text strings either in a separate sheet in the GGDM Excel spreadsheet or through an externally web-accessible registry. CDB 1.0 has no equivalent to this kind of enumeration.

Groupings to organize entity types into datasets, collections, and categories are substantially different between CDB 1.0 and GGDM and this difference will need to be reconciled.

One concept that exists explicitly in the NAS but is implicit and not stated in GGDM and CDB 1.0 is the notion of physical quantities, which describe the types of measurements that may be made for values. For example, a quantity of "Length" is defined to measure linear distance and the measurement units of "metre" and "foot" are realizations of that quantity. This concept is primarily used to identify which units may be converted to each other and what those conversion factors are.

==== Feature Subcodes not in GGDM

One very concrete difference between CDB 1.0 and GGDM is that CDB 1.0 defines a built-in concept of "Feature Subcode" in addition to the normal "Feature Code" specifying the 5-letter code. This feature subcode is, in practice, stored as a separate attribute in the vector attribution table and is an integer value of up to three digits describing a specific subtype of the broader feature type. The introduction of feature subcodes was a substantial change from the originating FACC standard and no other standard we assessed uses this concept. Relatively few CDB feature types use feature subcodes; however, the ones that do tend to be highly relevant such as power plants, buildings, vegetation, and building interior components.

Based on assessment, many but not all of the CDB subcodes originated from different FACC enumerated attributes playing a more specialized role. For example, the subcodes for AD010 "Power_Plant" are directly traceable to the values of the POS "Power Source" attribute which still exist on the GGDM AD010 "ELECTRIC_POWER_STATION_P" although CDB defines some additional values that are not present in FACC or GGDM such as "Solar", "Wind", and "Internal_Comb". In some cases very general attributes such as FFN "Feature Function", PPO "Physical Product", MFY "Medical Facility Type", and so on are used to make these distinctions in GGDM particularly in regards to buildings and structures. Due to the lack of definitions for individual vegetation objects and building interior components in GGDM - as previously identified by STE One World Terrain - the CDB 1.0 feature subcodes for these types are objects are novel and have no counterpart in GGDM.

CDB X cannot include the concept of feature subcode and remain compatible with GGDM, NAS, or OWT. A mapping strategy will need to be defined and missing semantic definitions will need to be added to the CDB X extension of GGDM, ideally formulated using NCV vocabulary so it can be submitted back to the developers of GGDM and NAS for inclusion in future revisions of those standards. We tentatively recommend treating the CDB feature subcode as an attribute rather than its own concept whose valid enumerated values are different depending on the entity type. Where possible, this attribute should be mapped to existing GGDM attributes such as POS, FFN, and PPO. In cases where an appropriate attribute exists but not all feature subcodes have valid mappings, we recommend adding new enumerant values to represent those concepts using the existing CDB definitions. In cases where appropriate attributes or entity types do not already exist in GGDM, additional decisions need to be made. The first decision is whether to create separate entity types for each subcode definition if they are sufficiently different from each other - and these can be still be related by subclassing relationships at the logical level as is done in the NAS - or to create a single entity type encompassing all of them and then defining an enumerated attribute to represent the possible feature subcodes. Building interiors merit a separate discussion due to the complexity and role other external standards play.
